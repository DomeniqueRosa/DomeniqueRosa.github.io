## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite + Vue](https://vite.dev//) - JS library

### What I learned

In this project, I learned to work with the Vue framework using Vite, creating reusable components and setting up routes. I studied directives like v-if, :disabled, and :class to control elements and dynamically apply CSS classes, helping me build dynamic and efficient web applications.

## Acknowledgments

### Step 1: Install Vite

 - npm create vite@latest 

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Inside the folder of the project

- npm install

### Step 3: Install Router

- npm install vue-router

### Step 4: Run the development server

- npm run dev

### Step 5:  Building the App for Production

- npm run build

This will generate a dist folder containing all the optimized files for production.
