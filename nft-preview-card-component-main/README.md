### What I learned

I learned to add interactivity to elements using JavaScript's classList.toggle() method to toggle (add or remove) a class from an element, making it easier to apply dynamic styles. Additionally, I learned to use normalize.css to reset the default styles from browsers, providing a more consistent base and making it easier to customize the design.
