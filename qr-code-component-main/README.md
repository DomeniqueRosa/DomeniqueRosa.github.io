## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I just learned how to use Flexbox to align items in the center. First, I set the containerâ€™s display property to flex, which activates Flexbox. Then, to align the items horizontally, I use justify-content: center. For vertical alignment, I apply align-items: center. This combination ensures that the items are centered both horizontally and vertically within the container. It's also important to make sure the container has a defined height, like 100vh, so that the vertical alignment can work properly.

```
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```
