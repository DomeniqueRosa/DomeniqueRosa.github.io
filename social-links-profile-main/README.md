# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution

This is a solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned


I learned how to use CSS Grid to create flexible layouts by defining rows and columns. I can now align items within specific grid areas using properties like grid-column and grid-row. Additionally, Iâ€™ve used the em unit to make fonts responsive, ensuring they adapt to different screen sizes. This knowledge allows me to build more dynamic and adaptable web designs.
